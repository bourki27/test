# welcome aboard SPACECADET

As a developer on the project, you'll be tasked with building a set of shiny new features to better serve interplanetary travelers. Before we lay out what we're looking to add to SPACECADET, let's get familiar with what it is in the first place.

## space travel made easy(ish)

Unlike at ground-level, where cities and landmarks stay put, planets are constantly orbiting their star. That makes knowing how far your destination is on a given day a real pain. Plus, even the latest and greatest interplanetary ships can only travel up to 200,000 kilometers at a time before running out of juice.

## a look at how it works

Enter SPACECADET (Site Pioneering Aliens Can Enter Criteria And Demystify Extraplanetary Travel), a handy tool that takes the guesswork out of planet hopping.

### Step 1

Enter your departure and destination planets, along with the day you plan to set off.

### Step 2

Once you've made your choices, we pass them on to our API, which returns the distance between the planets in kilometers.

### Step 3

If the distance is smaller than 200,000 kilometers, it's all systems go. If not, it's time for a change of plans.
